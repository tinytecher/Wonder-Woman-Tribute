This project is a Wonder Woman fan website created as part of the FreeCodeCamp curriculum. It showcases various aspects of Wonder Woman's character, history, and fun facts. The project is built using HTML and CSS and serves as a hands-on learning experience to enhance HTML and CSS skills.

## Main Learnings from CSS

Throughout this project, I gained a deeper understanding of various CSS concepts and techniques. Some of the key learnings include:

1. **CSS Selectors and Styling:** I learned how to select HTML elements using different types of CSS selectors and apply styles to them. This project uses a combination of element selectors, class selectors, and ID selectors to target specific elements and apply styling rules.

2. **Responsive Design:** I explored the principles of responsive design by using media queries to adapt the layout and styling of the website to different screen sizes. This ensures that the website looks visually appealing and functions well on various devices.

3. **Box Model:** I gained insight into the CSS box model, including properties like `padding`, `margin`, and `border`, which affect the spacing and layout of elements on the page.

4. **Flexbox:** The project employs Flexbox layout techniques to create a flexible and responsive design for the navigation bar and the flip card boxes section.

5. **Positioning:** I learned about the different positioning options in CSS, such as `relative`, `absolute`, and `fixed`, and how they impact the placement of elements within the layout.

6. **Transforms and Transitions:** The flip card boxes section demonstrates the use of CSS transforms and transitions to create a visually engaging card flipping effect on hover.

7. **Typography and Fonts:** I explored typography choices and applied custom fonts to enhance the visual appeal of the website's text content.

8. **Color and Styling:** The project highlights the use of color choices, background styling, and border effects to create a visually appealing and cohesive design.

## CSS Reset

In this project, I included a CSS reset file to ensure consistent and predictable styling across different browsers. The CSS reset helps to normalize default browser styles and behaviors, providing a clean slate to apply custom styling. By using the CSS reset, I ensure that my project has a solid foundation and reduces potential cross-browser inconsistencies.

The provided CSS reset file adopts best practices from various sources, such as Eric Meyer, HTML5 Doctor, and HTML5 Boilerplate, to establish a baseline for styling elements and prevent unexpected default styles.
